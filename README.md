This figure shows the comparison between erosivity `Re` from observation data `Re_5min_RIST`(delta_t=5 min) by RIST software and `Re_60min` (delta_t=60 min) with respect to `Re_5min` (delta_t=5 min).
delta_t is time incremenet in dataset
## Figure 2: Length of Datasets

This figure shows the number of events in erosivity `Re` based on different method and in delta_t
